# Library

## Introduction

This is a simple and interactive Library application built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. Users can add books to their personal collection using a form interface, view them as cards, toggle their read status, and remove books as needed.
Please note: this project currently does not use a database or local storage, so data will not persist after refreshing the page.
